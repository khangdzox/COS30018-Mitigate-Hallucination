We establish that phosphorylation of Yox1p at Ser114, Thr115 is required for maximal checkpoint-dependent activation of the G1\/S cell-cycle transcriptional program.\n\n        ### Input:\n        Does phosphorylation of the MBF repressor Yox1p by the DNA replication checkpoint keep the G1\/S cell-cycle transcriptional program active?\n\n        ### Response:\n        Yes. This study shows that checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation of Yox1p at Ser114, Thr115 results in repression of the MBF transcriptional program. The remodeling of the cell cycle transcriptional program by the DNA replication checkpoint is likely to comprise an important mechanism for the avoidance of genomic instability.\n\n        ### Evaluation:<|eot_id|>","token_count":385}

{"question":"Is downregulation of Jun kinase signaling in the amnioserosa essential for dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo?","context":"During Drosophila embryogenesis, Jun kinase (JNK) signaling has been shown to play a key role in regulating the morphogenetic process of dorsal closure, which also serves as a model for epithelial sheet fusion during wound repair. During dorsal closure the JNK signaling cascade in the dorsal-most (leading edge) cells of the epidermis activates the AP-1 transcription factor comprised of DJUN and DFOS that, in turn, upregulates the expression of the dpp gene. DPP is a secreted morphogen that signals lateral epidermal cells to elongate along the dorsoventral axis. The leading edge cells contact the peripheral cells of a monolayer extraembryonic epithelium, the amnioserosa, which lies on the dorsal side of the embryo. Focal complexes are present at the dorsal-most membrane of the leading edge cells, where they contact the amnioserosa.\nWe show that the JNK signaling cascade is initially active in both the amnioserosa and the leading edge of the epidermis. JNK signaling is downregulated in the amnioserosa, but not in the leading edge, prior to dorsal closure. The subcellular localization of DFOS and DJUN is responsive to JNK signaling in the amnioserosa: JNK activation results in nuclear localization of DFOS and DJUN; the downregulation of JNK signaling results in the relocalization of DFOS and DJUN to the cytoplasm. The HINDSIGHT (HNT) Zn-finger protein and the PUCKERED (PUC) JNK phosphatase are essential for downregulation of the JNK cascade in the amnioserosa.

{"question":"How many yards difference was Kris Brown's first field goal compared to his second?","context":" The game started out with the teams trading punts, and when Houston attempted a punt from the Jets' 37-yard line, punter Chad Stanley fumbled the snap and the Jets had the ball at their own 46-yard line. A 36-yard completion from Chad Pennington to Laveranues Coles almost went for naught when Leon Washington fumbled a short pass, but Brad Smith recovered. Mike Nugent booted a 23-yard field goal to put the Jets on the board. On the Jets' next drive, Pennington led the Jets into Houston territory, aided by a pass-interference call on DeMarcus Faggins.

{"question":"How many field goals did Elam kick in OT?","context":" Hoping to rebound from their embarrassing home loss to the Lions, the Raiders flew to Invesco Field at Mile High for an AFC West duel with the Denver Broncos.  In the first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Broncos QB Jay Cutler completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Raiders got on the board with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 38-yard field goal.  However, Denver continued to pound away as RB Cecil Sapp got a 4-yard TD run, while kicker Jason Elam got a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Oakland began to come back as QB Josh McCown (who was a gametime decision heading into the game) completed a 46-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Raiders took the lead as DT Gerard Warren sacked Cutler in the end zone for a safety, while LB Thomas Howard returned an interception 44 yards for a touchdown (followed by a successful two-point conversion pass from McCown to WR Ronald Curry).  However, the Broncos tied the game up with Elam's 20-yard field goal.  In overtime, Oakland managed to make Denver go three-and-out on their first possession.

This study also explored whether referring physicians are interested in radiation education and was an initial effort to address their CT ordering behavior.\nTwo to four months after a radiologist's lecture on the potential effects of radiation exposure related to CT scans, urology and orthopedic residents were surveyed regarding the number and types of CT scans they ordered, the use of alternative imaging modalities, and whether they used the lecture information to educate patients.\nTwenty-one resident lecture attendants completed the survey. The number of CT scans ordered after the lecture stayed constant for 90% (19 of 21) and decreased for 10% (two of 21). The types of CT scans ordered changed after the lecture for 14% (three of 21). Thirty-three percent (seven of 21) reported increases in alternative imaging after the lecture, including 24% (five of 21) reporting increases in magnetic resonance imaging and 19% (four of 21) reporting increases in ultrasound. Patients directed questions about radiation exposure to 57% (12 of 21); 38% (eight of 21) used the lecture information to educate patients. Referring physicians were interested in the topic, and afterward, other physician groups requested radiation education lectures.\n\n        ### Input:\n        Will CT ordering practices change if we educate residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure?\n\n        ### Response:\n        Yes. Most clinicians significantly changed their CT scan ordering after receiving education about radiation from a radiologist. Radiation education allowed clinicians to discuss CT benefits and risks with their patients and to choose appropriate CT protocols. Referring physician groups are interested in this topic, and radiologists should be encouraged to give radiation lectures to them.\n\n        ### Evaluation:<|eot_id|>","token_count":423}

In vitro, pioglitazone alone and together with losartan was more effective than losartan alone in dampening lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production, suppressing M1 phenotypic change while enhancing M2 phenotypic change.\n\n        ### Input:\n        Is atherosclerosis following renal injury ameliorated by pioglitazone and losartan via macrophage phenotype?\n\n        ### Response:\n        Yes. Combination of pioglitazone and losartan is more effective in reducing renal injury-induced atherosclerosis than either treatment alone. This benefit reflects mitigation in macrophage cytokine production, enhanced apoptosis, and a shift toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype.\n\n        ### Evaluation:<|eot_id|>","token_count":660}

Crosby connected again in the third quarter on a 31-yard field goal. The big blow of the game came just 1:26 later, when Aaron Rodgers found James Jones deep, resulting in an 83-yard touchdown and a 16-3 Green Bay lead. Two more Crosby field goals of 42 and 45 yards put the game out of reach. Matthew Stafford hit Kris Durham with a 13-yard TD pass late in the final quarter to make the score 22-9 (following a failed 2-point conversion), but it was too little, too late.\n\n### Input:\nHow many field goals of over 50-yards were made?\n\n### Response:\n['2', '3', '2', '2', '2', '1', '0']\n\n### Evaluation:<|eot_id|>","token_count":313}

The entire alpine population of brown bears includes about 50 individuals, most of them living in the Adamello-Presanella Alps in Italy. Reintroduction of 10 Slovenian brown bears to the Trentino area in 1998 and 2002 produced occasional visitors to the South Tirol, the Swiss Geography of the Alpss, Bavaria and isolated sightings in the Geography of the Alpss. The small group of bears living in the Carinthian-Slovenian Alps is connected to the larger Dinaric-Pindos population.\n\n### Input:\nWhich two locations in Northern Europe have the highest large bear population?\n\n### Response:\n['Sweden', 'Norway']\n\n### Evaluation:<|eot_id|>","token_count":363}

ABCG1 has a lesser role in cholesterol efflux and a negligible role in efflux to HDL3b and HDL3c subfractions.\n\n        ### Input:\n        Is hDL particle size a critical determinant of ABCA1-mediated macrophage cellular cholesterol export?\n\n        ### Response:\n        Yes. Small, dense HDL subfractions are the most efficient mediators of cholesterol efflux, and ABCA1 mediates cholesterol efflux to small dense HDL and to lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I. HDL-directed therapies should target increasing the concentrations or the cholesterol efflux capacity of small, dense HDL species in vivo.\n\n        ### Evaluation:<|eot_id|>","token_count":450}

After filing a claim with the court and submitting proof of the amounts owed to you, the business must answer and explain why the debt is not owed.\n\npassage 3:After processing, one (1) copy will be attached to the titling documentation along with a copy of the lien fee receipt. One (1) copy, along with a copy of the lien fee receipt, will be sent to OTC in the agents semi-monthly report. One (1) will be filed at the MLA\u2019s office. One (1) copy of the lien entry form, one (1) copy of the lien fee receipt and the four (4) part lien release form will be returned to the lien holder.\n\n\n\n        ### Input:\n        how do i file a lien on a semi\n\n        ### Response:\n        Based on the provided passages, here are the steps to file a lien on a semi:\n\nPassage 1 does not provide any information on how to file a lien on a semi. The passage discusses the rights of a judgment creditor to attach property transferred to a spouse, but it does not mention anything about filing a lien on a semi. Therefore, I cannot provide guidance on this matter based on this passage.\n\nPassage 2 explains the process for placing a lien on business property through a court order. It outlines the steps involved in filing a claim with the court and submitting proof of the amount owed to you, followed by the business's response to the debt. However, this passage does not provide information on how to file a lien on a semi.\n\nPassage 3 provides instructions on how to file a lien on a specific type of property called an \"OTC\" (Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Account). The passage explains how one copy of the lien entry form, along with supporting documents, will be attached to the titling documentation, while another copy will be sent to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission. However, this passage does not address how to file a lien on a semi.\n\nBased on the provided passages, I am unable to answer your question regarding how to file a lien on a semi.\n\n        ### Evaluation:<|eot_id|>","token_count":615}

Out of this sample 199 patients were treated with U-blade (RC) lag screws. A total of 135 patients (117 female, 18 male) with standard lag screw (treatment group A) were matched equally regarding age (\u00b14 years) sex, fracture type and location to 135 patients with U-blade (RC) lag screw (treatment group B). Within a mean follow up of 9.2 months (range 6-18 months) we assessed the cut-out rate, the calTAD, lag screw migration, the Parker's mobility score and the Parker's ratio at postoperatively, six and 12 months following surgery. Furthermore we recorded all complications, ASA-Score, hospital stay and duration of surgery retrospectively.\nThe most common fracture among group B with a cut-out of the lag screw were AO\/OTA 2.3 and 3.2 fractures whereas in group A cut-out was most commonly seen in AO\/OTA 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 fractures, there was no significant reduction of the cut-out rate in group B 2.2% (n=3) compared to group A 3.7% (n=5). The duration of surgery was significantly shorter in group A (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in lag screw placement, the Parker's ratio and mobilization.\n\n        ### Input:\n        Does an additional antirotation U-Blade (RC) lag screw improve treatment of AO\/OTA 31 A1-3 fractures with gamma 3 nail?\n\n        ### Response:\n        No. In our study the U-Blade (RC) lag screw did not reduce the cut-out in treatment of OTA\/AO 31A1-3 fractures at all. Considering the longer duration of surgery and the higher costs of the U-Blade (RC) lag screw, our results do not justify its use. However, further prospective randomized studies will be necessary.\n\n        ### Evaluation:<|eot_id|>","token_count":592}
