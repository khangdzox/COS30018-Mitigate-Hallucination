# Mitigating Halucination by Finetuning

What is Fine-Tuning?
Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to perform better on specific tasks or domains. This process helps the model gain specialized knowledge beyond its general language understanding.

Impact on hallucination:
Fine-tuning resize the model to a specific domain only so that model will have deeper knowledge about that field and reduce the hallucination.

Fine-Tuning approach:
1. QLoRA
2. Hyper-parameter tuning
