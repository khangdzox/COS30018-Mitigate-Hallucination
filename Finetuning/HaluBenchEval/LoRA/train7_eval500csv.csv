Does cYP2C9 genotype affect risk of tobacco-related cancer in the general population?,"CYP2C9 enzymes are important in the metabolism of procarcinogenic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in tobacco smoke. Two functional variants in the CYP2C9 gene (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) are known to be associated with decreased enzyme activity towards tolbutamide and warfarin, while this has not been investigated for PAHs. We hypothesised that these two variants in the CYP2C9 gene influence risk of tobacco-related cancer.
In a prospective study of the general population (n=10 392) with 60 years of follow-up, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, we associated two variants of CYP2C9 (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) with risk of tobacco-related cancer and all cancer. All results were re-tested in a cross-sectional study of the general population (n=36 856), the Copenhagen General Population Study.
We found no association between any of the CYP2C9 genotypes and risk of tobacco-related cancer, individual tobacco-related cancers, or all cancer. For the combined carriers (any CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 heterozygotes or homozygotes) vs. non-carriers we had 90% statistical power to exclude measures of relative risks below/above 0.8/1.2 and 0.9/1.1 in the Copenhagen City Heart Study and below/above 0.8/1.3 and 0.9/1.1 in the Copenhagen General Population Study for tobacco-related cancer and all cancer, respectively.",FAIL,"The provided answer is correct.

Does phosphorylation of the MBF repressor Yox1p by the DNA replication checkpoint keep the G1/S cell-cycle transcriptional program active?,"In fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe G1/S cell-cycle regulated transcription depends upon MBF. A negative feedback loop involving Nrm1p and Yox1p bound to MBF leads to transcriptional repression as cells exit G1 phase. However, activation of the DNA replication checkpoint response during S phase results in persistent expression of MBF-dependent genes.
This report shows that Yox1p binding to MBF is Nrm1-dependent and that Yox1p and Nrm1p require each other to bind and repress MBF targets. In response to DNA replication stress both Yox1p and Nrm1p dissociate from MBF at promoters leading to de-repression of MBF targets. Inactivation of Yox1p is an essential part of the checkpoint response. Cds1p (human Chk2p) checkpoint protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Yox1p promotes its dissociation from the MBF transcription factor. We establish that phosphorylation of Yox1p at Ser114, Thr115 is required for maximal checkpoint-dependent activation of the G1/S cell-cycle transcriptional program.",FAIL,"The provided answer is incorrect.

The question asks if phosphorylation of Yox1p by the DNA replication checkpoint keeps the G1/S cell-cycle transcriptional program active, but the answer states that it results in repression of the MBF transcriptional program, which is opposite of the expected result.

how well do patterned rollers work,"passage 1:In fact, homemade texture or decorative paint rollers can work better than the commercial variety because many faux finishes rely on applying a random pattern of texture to your walls, and commercial texture rollers apply paint with a set pattern.

passage 2:I have been using the Dermaroller for a couple of months now and I think it does make a difference in my skin. I have been using the 1mm and it seems like it works better on my face than my neck and chest. When I tried the 1mm on those areas, they got super red, so I stopped. It seems like it is stimulating my skin and it looks younger and I have noticed that it has more of a healthy glow as well. We have so many before and after pictures on our site, so I can see that it does work as well. I have found that they do work best with the serums or moisturizers used right after. We do have a great kit that is perfect for anti-aging.

passage 3:Basic Texture Roller. Place a roller pad with 1-inch or thicker nap (padding) on a roller frame. An old pad that has been used and not thoroughly cleaned (so some of the tufts clump together) works best for this. Stretch and twist rubber bands around the pad at a variety of angles, creating clumps and random patterns with tufts and lines. Apply paint to your walls with this roller as you would with any roller, but slightly adjust the rubber bands periodically as you work to renew the texture.

",PASS,"The provided answer is correct.

Here is the evaluation:

The passage 1 talks about the advantage of homemade patterned rollers for painting, which can provide a random pattern that is favorable for many faux finishes.

The passage 2 talks about the Dermaroller for skincare, which has been found to improve skin texture, stimulate the skin, and provide a healthier glow.

The passage 3 provides instructions on how to make a basic texture roller for painting.

The answer correctly states that patterned rollers can work well for both painting and skincare applications, and provides evidence from the passages to support this statement.

Therefore, the answer is correct, so the",0,0,0,0,0,0,467
Are variants in CXADR and F2RL1 associated with blood pressure and obesity in African-Americans in regions identified through admixture mapping?,"Genetic variants in 296 genes in regions identified through admixture mapping of hypertension, BMI, and lipids were assessed for association with hypertension, blood pressure (BP), BMI, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).
This study identified coding SNPs identified from HapMap2 data that were located in genes on chromosomes 5, 6, 8, and 21, wherein ancestry association evidence for hypertension, BMI, or HDL-C was identified in previous admixture mapping studies. Genotyping was performed in 1733 unrelated African-Americans from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Family Blood Pressure Project, and gene-based association analyses were conducted for hypertension, SBP, DBP, BMI, and HDL-C. A gene score based on the number of minor alleles of each SNP in a gene was created and used for gene-based regression analyses, adjusting for age, age, sex, local marker ancestry, and BMI, as applicable. An individual's African ancestry estimated from 2507 ancestry-informative markers was also adjusted for to eliminate any confounding due to population stratification.
CXADR (rs437470) on chromosome 21 was associated with SBP and DBP with or without adjusting for local ancestry (P < 0.0006). F2RL1 (rs631465) on chromosome 5 was associated with BMI (P = 0.0005). Local ancestry in these regions was associated with the respective traits as well.",FAIL,"The provided answer is correct.

Here is the explanation:
The study indeed found that variants in CXADR (rs437470) on chromosome 21 were associated with SBP and DBP, and variants in F2RL1 (rs631465) on chromosome 5 were associated with BMI. This is consistent with the question, which asks if CXADR and F2RL1 are associated with blood pressure and obesity in African-Americans.

Which university affiliation of Jeremy Wertheimer offered free tuition for over 100 years?," The company was founded by Jeremy Wertheimer, a computer scientist from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Cooper Union, with his partner Richard Aiken in 1996. Inspired in 1830 when Peter Cooper learned about the government-supported École Polytechnique in France, Cooper Union was established in 1859. The Cooper Union originally granted each admitted student a full-tuition scholarship. A consent decree brokered by the New York Attorney General in New York Supreme Court, and finalized in 2015, required the establishment of a Free Education Committee with the responsibility to present a strategic plan, no later than January 15, 2018, for consideration by the school's Board of Trustees, who would then vote on it at their Board meeting in March 2018, to allow the school to return to a sustainable tuition-free model.",FAIL,"### Response:

The question asks which university affiliation of Jeremy Wertheimer offered free tuition for over 100 years.

According to the context, it is mentioned that Cooper Union originally granted each admitted student a full-tuition scholarship, which means it offered free tuition. And it is also mentioned that Jeremy Wertheimer co-founded the company with his partner Richard Aiken in 1996, which implies that he is affiliated with Cooper Union.

Double reading of barium enemas: is it necessary?,"The purpose of our study was to determine the effectiveness, clinical impact, and feasibility of double reading barium enemas.
Independent double readings of 1,003 consecutive barium enemas (822 double- and 181 single-contrast examinations) were prospectively performed. From this pool of 1,003 examinations, 994 were included in our study. Examinations showing at least one polyp or carcinoma 5 mm or larger were considered to have positive results. For combined readings, results were considered positive if either of the two interpreters reported finding a polyp or carcinoma. A McNemar test was used to compare the first reader's results with the combined results of the first and second readers. Results were retrospectively correlated with endoscopic or surgical results in 360 patients, and agreement between first and combined readings and endoscopic results was determined.
Adding a second reader increased the number of positive results on examinations from 249 to 315 (p<0.0001) and resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients (9.9%). Sensitivity of the first and combined readings for detection of all lesions was identical, 76.3% (95% CI, 65.4-87.1%). Specificity decreased from 91.0% (95% CI, 87.9-94.3%) for the first reading to 86.4% (95% CI, 82.2-90.0%) for the combined reading. The overall measurement of agreement decreased from a kappa value of 61.8 (95% CI, 51.2-72.4%) for the first reading to 52.9 (95% CI, 42.2-63.6%) for the combined reading. The second reading required an average of 3.3 min. Sensitivity for the detection of adenocarcinomas was 100%.",PASS,"The provided answer is correct.

Here is the explanation:
The study found that adding a second reader increased the number of positive results, but this was accompanied by a higher false-positive rate. The sensitivity for detection of polyps was identical for the first and combined readings, but the specificity decreased. The overall agreement between the readers also decreased. Therefore, the study concluded that double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity and produces a higher false-positive rate, suggesting that it is not necessary.",0,0,0,0,0,0,491
Does proteomic analysis reveal molecular biological details in varioliform gastritis without Helicobacter pylori infection?,"To investigate and elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying varioliform gastritis for early detection, prevention and intervention of gastric cancer.
A combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry was used to detect the differentially expressed proteins between varioliform gastritis and matched normal mucosa. The selected proteins were confirmed by Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in additional samples and the function of some proteins in varioliform gastritis was analyzed by bio-method preliminarily.
We identified 21 differentially expressed proteins in varioliform gastritis, and compared them with matched normal mucosa. Eleven proteins were upregulated and ten downregulated in varioliform gastritis when compared with the same proteins in individual-matched normal gastric mucosa. These proteins are related to metabolism, oxidation, cytoskeleton, apoptosis, signal transduction and other aspects of cells. Two novel proteins, thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 (TXNDC5) upregulated in varioliform gastritis, and neuropolypeptide h3 [phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1)] downregulated in varioliform gastritis, were further investigated. Their expressions were validated by Western blotting and RT-PCR in 12 cases of varioliform gastritis which was matched with normal mucosa. The expression level of PEBP1 in varioliform gastritis was significantly lower (P < 0.05) while that of TXNDC5 was significantly higher than that in matched normal gastric mucosa (P < 0.05).",PASS,"The provided answer is correct.

Do thrombophilic variables increase the generation or procoagulant activity of thrombin during cardiopulmonary bypass?,"The generation of thrombin and its procoagulant activity are upregulated during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Thrombophilia associates with increased basal thrombin generation and might therefore propagate thrombin generation during CPB. The objective of this study was to test whether preoperative thrombophilic variables associate with increased generation of thrombin or its procoagulant activity during and after CPB.
Comprehensive thrombophilia screening was performed in patients (n = 100) before elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with CPB. Markers of thrombin generation (prothrombin fragment F1+2), its procoagulant activity (soluble fibrin complexes), and a marker of fibrin degradation (D-dimer) were measured serially at eight time points before, during, and after CABG.
Abnormal thrombophilia screening was common (44%). While patients with thrombophilic variables had higher preoperative prothrombin fragment F1+2 than others (median [interquartile range] 0.55 [0.34] vs 0.45 (0.21) nmol/L, p = 0.009) they did not have higher F1+2, D-dimer, or soluble fibrin complex levels during CPB or postoperatively than patients without thrombophilic variables.",FAIL,"The provided answer is correct.

Here is the explanation:
The question asks if thrombophilic variables increase the generation or procoagulant activity of thrombin during cardiopulmonary bypass.

The study found that preoperative thrombophilic variables did not associate with increased generation or procoagulant activity of thrombin during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. The answer is actually ""No"", not ""Yes"".

Are lIN28B polymorphisms associated with central precocious puberty and early puberty in girls?,"Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers within LIN28B have been reported to be related to the timing of pubertal growth. However, no study has investigated the frequency of genetic markers in girls with precocious puberty (PP) or early puberty (EP). This study aimed to determine the frequency of putative genetic markers in girls with PP or EP.
Genomic DNAs were obtained from 77 and 109 girls that fulfilled the criteria for PP and EP, respectively. The controls in this study were 144 healthy volunteers between 20 and 30 years of age. The haplotypes were reconstructed using 11 SNPs of LIN28B, and haplotype association analysis was performed. The haplotype frequencies were compared. Differences in the clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed according to the haplotype dosage.
Eleven SNPs in LIN28B were all located in a block that was in linkage disequilibrium. The haplotype could be reconstructed using 2 representative SNPs, rs4946651 and rs369065. The AC haplotype was less frequently observed in the PP group than in the controls (0.069 vs. 0.144, P=0.010). The trend that girls with non-AC haplotypes tended to have earlier puberty onset (P=0.037) was illustrated even in the EP+PP patient group by Kaplan-Meier analysis.",FAIL,"The provided answer is correct.

Here is the explanation:
The study found that the AC haplotype was less frequently observed in the PP group than in the controls (0.069 vs. 0.144, P=0.010), which suggests an association between the AC haplotype and central precocious puberty in girls. The opposite is true for non-AC haplotypes, which were more frequently observed in the PP group than in the controls. Therefore, the study actually found an association between non-AC haplotypes of LIN28B and PP in girls, not no association.

Is downregulation of Jun kinase signaling in the amnioserosa essential for dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo?,"During Drosophila embryogenesis, Jun kinase (JNK) signaling has been shown to play a key role in regulating the morphogenetic process of dorsal closure, which also serves as a model for epithelial sheet fusion during wound repair. During dorsal closure the JNK signaling cascade in the dorsal-most (leading edge) cells of the epidermis activates the AP-1 transcription factor comprised of DJUN and DFOS that, in turn, upregulates the expression of the dpp gene. DPP is a secreted morphogen that signals lateral epidermal cells to elongate along the dorsoventral axis. The leading edge cells contact the peripheral cells of a monolayer extraembryonic epithelium, the amnioserosa, which lies on the dorsal side of the embryo. Focal complexes are present at the dorsal-most membrane of the leading edge cells, where they contact the amnioserosa.
We show that the JNK signaling cascade is initially active in both the amnioserosa and the leading edge of the epidermis. JNK signaling is downregulated in the amnioserosa, but not in the leading edge, prior to dorsal closure. The subcellular localization of DFOS and DJUN is responsive to JNK signaling in the amnioserosa: JNK activation results in nuclear localization of DFOS and DJUN; the downregulation of JNK signaling results in the relocalization of DFOS and DJUN to the cytoplasm. The HINDSIGHT (HNT) Zn-finger protein and the PUCKERED (PUC) JNK phosphatase are essential for downregulation of the JNK cascade in the amnioserosa. Persistent JNK activity in the amnioserosa leads to defective focal complexes in the adjacent leading edge cells and to the failure of dorsal closure.",PASS,"The provided answer is correct.

Here is the explanation:
The question asks if downregulation of Jun kinase signaling in the amnioserosa is essential for dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo. The answer is yes, which is supported by the text. The text states that the downregulation of JNK signaling in the amnioserosa is essential for dorsal closure, and that persistent JNK activity in the amnioserosa leads to defective focal complexes and the failure of dorsal closure.

How many yards difference was Kris Brown's first field goal compared to his second?," The game started out with the teams trading punts, and when Houston attempted a punt from the Jets' 37-yard line, punter Chad Stanley fumbled the snap and the Jets had the ball at their own 46-yard line. A 36-yard completion from Chad Pennington to Laveranues Coles almost went for naught when Leon Washington fumbled a short pass, but Brad Smith recovered. Mike Nugent booted a 23-yard field goal to put the Jets on the board. On the Jets' next drive, Pennington led the Jets into Houston territory, aided by a pass-interference call on DeMarcus Faggins. Nugent kicked a 34-yard field goal for a 6-0 Jets lead. Houston rebounded, with David Carr converting a key third down to Andre Johnson to set up Kris Brown's 47-yard field goal. Pennington completed a long pass to Jerricho Cotchery on the next drive to set up Nugent's career-long 54-yard field goal to give the Jets a 9-3 lead. The half ended when Brown came up five yards short on a 59-yard field goal attempt. On the Jets' first possession of the second half, following a Houston punt, Pennington completed long passes to Chris Baker and Cotchery before finding Coles on a 12-yard touchdown pass. On the Jets' next drive, fans everywhere held their breath when Pennington was drilled by Mario Williams while releasing a pass and was slow to get up. Luckily, he only had the wind knocked out of him. Kerry Rhodes intercepted Carr soon after, and Pennington completed another long pass to Cotchery to set up Cedric Houston's 1-yard touchdown run and a 23-3 lead. The Jets' final score came after a 13-play drive that ate up 8:27, capped by Nugent's 40-yard field goal, his fourth of the game. Houston closed the scoring when Carr found Johnson in the end zone, and then completed a two-point conversion pass to Wali Lundy.",FAIL,"The first field goal by Kris Brown was 47 yards.

what is the effect of carbon footprint,"passage 1:Your carbon footprint measures the environmental impact of your lifestyle. Everything you do has an impact --- positive or negative --- on the environment. That's the concept behind your carbon footprint, which is one method of measuring the environmental effect of your lifestyle. A carbon footprint, measured in tons, indicates the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are produced as a result of your daily activities. You can reduce your footprint by changing the way you live your life. Even seemingly tiny changes can make a significant difference.

passage 2:It all comes back to the average carbon footprint. The average per capita carbon footprint is 6 tons per year. In the U.S. the average is 20 tons per year, and a third of that is created by automobile emissions -- meaning your car itself can put out over 6 tons of C02 a year -- enough for two people.

passage 3:So what exactly is a carbon footprint? In simplest terms, carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases produced by various human activities within a given time frame. Carbon footprint is usually measured in tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere. Your home has a carbon footprint if you use oil, coal or gas to heat it. That cheeseburger at your favorite restaurant has a carbon footprint: raising the beef and wheat and operating the restaurant all involves greenhouse gases. Your car has a carbon footprint, dependent on the vehicle’s fuel consumption and driving distance.

",PASS,"The provided answer is correct.

Here is the evaluation:

The question asks about the effect of a carbon footprint, and the answer correctly states that it is a measure of the negative impact of human activities on the environment, and that reducing one's carbon footprint can have a positive impact on the environment.

The answer is supported by information from all three passages. Passage 1 introduces the concept of a carbon footprint as a measure of the environmental impact of one's lifestyle. Passage 2 provides context about the average carbon footprint and its composition. Passage 3 defines a carbon footprint and explains that it is usually measured in tons of carbon dioxide (CO2",0,0,0,0,0,0,444

Does heterogeneous atrial denervation create substrate for sustained atrial fibrillation?,"Heterogeneous electrophysiological properties, which may be due in part to autonomic innervation, are important in the maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that heterogeneous sympathetic denervation with phenol would create a milieu for sustained AF.
After the determination of baseline inducibility, 15 dogs underwent atrial epicardial phenol application and 11 underwent a sham procedure. After 2 weeks of recovery, the animals had repeat attempts at inducing AF and effective refractory period (ERP) testing. Epicardial maps were obtained to determine local AF cycle lengths. ERPs were determined at baseline and during sympathetic, vagal, and simultaneous vagal/sympathetic stimulation. Dogs then underwent PET imaging with either a sympathetic ([11C]hydroxyephedrine, HED) or parasympathetic (5-[11C]methoxybenzovesamicol, MOBV) nerve label. None of the animals had sustained AF (>60 minutes) at baseline. None of the sham dogs and 14 of 15 phenol dogs had sustained AF at follow-up. Sites to which phenol was applied had a significantly shorter ERP (136+/-17.6 ms) than those same sites in the sham controls (156+/-19.1 ms) (P=0.01). Although there was no difference in the ERP change with either vagal or sympathetic stimulation alone between phenol and nonphenol sites, the percent decrease in ERP with simultaneous vagal/sympathetic stimulation was greater in the phenol sites (17+/-8%) than in the nonphenol sites (9+/-9%) (P=0.01). There was a significantly increased dispersion of refractoriness (21+/-6.4 ms in the sham versus 58+/-14 ms in the phenol dogs, P=0.01) as well as dispersion of AF cycle length (49+/-10 ms in the sham versus 105+/-12 ms in the phenol dogs, P=0.0001). PET images demonstrated defects of HED uptake in the areas of phenol application, with no defect of MOBV uptake.",FAIL,"### Response: PASS

The provided answer is correct. The study found that heterogeneous sympathetic denervation with phenol application in dogs created a milieu for sustained atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the opposite of the expected outcome. The study showed that 14 out of 15 dogs developed sustained AF after phenol application, whereas none of the sham dogs developed sustained AF. This suggests that heterogeneous sympathetic denervation may actually facilitate the development of sustained AF, which is the opposite of the expected outcome.

Are plasma ghrelin levels normal in obese patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( pseudotumor cerebri )?,"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) occurs predominantly in young, obese women. Weight loss may alleviate symptoms of IIH yet may be difficult to achieve. Ghrelin, a gastric hormone, is involved in normal body weight and appetite regulation. Its levels are elevated in syndromes of overeating and decline in simple obesity. We postulated that fasting plasma ghrelin levels are elevated in IIH patients and that the typical postprandial decline in plasma ghrelin may not occur.
Prospective, observational case-control study.
Prospective study.
University hospital and clinic.
Sixty-five patients with a diagnosis of IIH and 25 obese control patients (screened for IIH symptoms). Patients with intracranial abnormalities or a history of gastric surgery were excluded.
Fasting plasma ghrelin, leptin, and insulin levels were assessed between 8 am and 10 am. Subjects were fed a standard breakfast, and postprandial ghrelin levels were measured 30 minutes later.
Fasting plasma ghrelin levels negatively correlated with body mass index in both IIH subjects (r = -.48) and controls; leptin showed a positive correlation with body mass index in both IIH (r =.59) and controls. Levels were not significantly different between the groups. Postprandial ghrelin declined by 71 +/- 31 (95% CI) pg/ml in the IIH group and 71 +/- 35 (95% CI) pg/ml in the control group.",FAIL,"FAIL

The provided answer is incorrect. According to the text, fasting plasma ghrelin levels negatively correlated with body mass index in both IIH subjects and controls, and postprandial ghrelin declined by similar amounts in both groups, which suggests that plasma ghrelin levels are not significantly different between IIH patients and obese controls.",0.075757576,6.63E-232,0.045454545,0.045454545,0.022727273,1,455

Do systemic interleukin-10 concentrations alter between the first and second trimester in normal pregnancy?,"Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is involved in normal fecundity and systemic IL-10 changes during gestation might reflect an immunologic shift at the maternal-fetal interface.
Serum IL-10 levels were measured in the first and second trimester of uncomplicated pregnancy in 32 women. The low interassay coefficient of variation of the low adjustor of the IL-10 assay (5.2%) enabled us to detect IL-10 concentrations between 0.50 pg/ml and 4.0 pg/ml.
There was no statistically significant difference between serum IL-10 levels in the first trimester (median 1.10; range 0.53-4.60 pg/ml) and second trimester (median 1.05; range 0.64-3.30 pg/ml).",FAIL,"### Evaluation:

The question asks if systemic interleukin-10 concentrations alter between the first and second trimester in normal pregnancy.

Does albumin at the start of peritoneal dialysis predict the development of peritonitis?,"Both peritonitis and serum albumin level are associated with morbidity and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Severe cases of peritonitis result in hypoalbuminemia. However, it is not clear whether hypoalbuminemia predicts the development of peritonitis.
We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database from six centers in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Incident PD patients with a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score at the start of PD therapy and serum albumin level measured within 30 days of initiation were selected. Poisson regression was used to analyze predictors of peritonitis.
Three hundred ninety-three patients had a CCI score and serum albumin level measured at the start of PD therapy. Overall peritonitis rate was 0.65 episodes/dialysis-year. Significant univariate predictors were albumin level (rate ratio [RR], 0.79 per 1-g/dL [10-g/L] increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.95; P = 0.015), male sex (P = 0.003), and being dialyzed in the Veterans Administration (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.62; P < 0.001) or other center (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.92 to 5.62; P < 0.001). Although CCI score correlated inversely with albumin level (r = -0.305; P < 0.001), CCI score was only marginally predictive of peritonitis (P = 0.068). In multivariate analysis, predictors were albumin level (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.75; P = 0.002) and race (RR, 1.36; P = 0.024). Patients with an initial serum albumin level less than 2.9 g/dL (29 g/L) had a peritonitis rate of 1.5 episodes/dialysis-year compared with 0.6 episodes/dialysis-year for patients with an initial serum albumin level of 2.9 g/dL or greater (P < 0.001).",PASS,"### Response: PASS

The provided answer is correct. According to the study, hypoalbuminemia at the start of PD therapy is an independent predictor of subsequent peritonitis, and patients with an initial serum albumin level less than 2.9 g/dL (29 g/L) had a higher peritonitis rate compared to those with an initial serum albumin level of 2.9 g/dL or greater.",0.064935065,6.34E-232,0.042553191,0.042553191,0.020408163,1,609

Dear Editor, Although COVID-19 has not been officially labelled as a pandemic yet, the global burden of disease is significant and continues to rise. The virus has a high humanto-human transmissibility via airborne, droplet and contact routes [1] . Patient numbers can surge, and hospitals should be ready not just with the infrastructure, but also staff to be familiar with workflows. Kain and Fowler [2] have eloquently detailed influenza pandemic preparations for hospitals and intensive care units, and we feel the principles described in the article are relevant to COVID-19. Staff must consider patient transfers in between wards, as COVID-19 patients are admitted in isolation facilities to contain infected cases and to avoid nosocomial spread [1] .

Infectious cases may be intentionally brought out of isolation rooms for various reasons. Intra-hospital transfer may be required from emergency departments to the wards, from the general floor to the intensive care unit and from the wards to radiology suites. Inter-hospital transfer may be required for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if patients with COVID-19 develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome within hospitals with only basic ventilation facilities. During episodes of patient transport outside of isolation, potential breaches of infection control can occur. At the same time, when COVID-19 patients turn ill during transport, their management is exceptionally challenging as accompanying staff would be wearing cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE) [3] .

Mitigating the spread of COVID-19 is a national priority in Singapore [4] , and part of this effort involves planning and conducting safe patient transport for suspected or confirmed cases. HCWs who handle the transport of COVID-19 patients must consider the following principles (see Table 1 ): firstly, early recognition of the deteriorating patient; secondly, HCW safety; thirdly, bystander safety; fourthly, contingency plans for medical emergencies during transport; fifthly, post-transport decontamination. Specific action steps require designated zones for transport [5] , sufficient supplies of PPE, staff training and support personnel like security officers and cleaning crews. Powered air-purifying respirators add a layer of safety on top of N95 respirators [3] and should be used if possible for high-risk cases, such as those requiring ambulance transport to ECMO centres.

Given the continued global spread of COVID-19, we expect that more hospitals will need to deal with this disease. Haphazard transport of infected cases leading to nosocomial spread can stymie efforts to break the chains of transmission. We hope that our suggestions can aid others in ensuring safe patient transport for COVID-19 and reduce nosocomial spread.

The Burmese control of the Shan States  came in 1557 when King Bayinnaung of the Toungoo dynasty conquered all of the Shan States. The border was never demarcated in the modern sense, with local Shan sawbwas  at the border regions paying tribute to both sides. The situation turned to China's favor in the 1730s when the Qing decided to impose a tighter control of Yunnan's border regions while the Burmese authority largely dissipated with the rapid decline of the Toungoo dynasty.",FAIL,"### Response: FAIL

The provided answer is incorrect. According to the context, the Qing decided to impose tighter control of Yunnan's border regions in the 1730s, not related to local resistance by the mid-1440s.

Are potassium channel activity and glutamate uptake impaired in astrocytes of seizure-susceptible DBA/2 mice?,"KCNJ10 encodes subunits of inward rectifying potassium (Kir) channel Kir4.1 found predominantly in glial cells within the brain. Genetic inactivation of these channels in glia impairs extracellular K(+) and glutamate clearance and produces a seizure phenotype. In both mice and humans, polymorphisms and mutations in the KCNJ10 gene have been associated with seizure susceptibility. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether there are differences in Kir channel activity and potassium- and glutamate-buffering capabilities between astrocytes from seizure resistant C57BL/6 (B6) and seizure susceptible DBA/2 (D2) mice that are consistent with an altered K(+) channel activity as a result of genetic polymorphism of KCNJ10.
Using cultured astrocytes and hippocampal brain slices together with whole-cell patch-clamp, we determined the electrophysiologic properties, particularly K(+) conductances, of B6 and D2 mouse astrocytes. Using a colorimetric assay, we determined glutamate clearance capacity by B6 and D2 astrocytes.

How long did the power stay out?," A power outage that disrupted play in the third quarter served as a fitting metaphor for the Giants' general lack of power on the field this night. Smith was sidelined by a torn pectoral muscle suffered during practice, and backup receiver Ramses Barden saw his season come to an end during this game by way of a torn Achilles tendon. Former Giant Jason Garrett was making his head coaching debut for a Cowboys team revitalized by the firing of head coach Wade Phillips one week earlier. The Dallas defense held the Giants to just 6 points in the first half, aided by cornerback Bryan McCann's 101-yard ""pick 6"" from his own end zone. In a dimly lit third quarter, after a bank of lights went dark, Felix Jones extended the Cowboys' lead to 20 points on a 71-yard touchdown reception. Only after a total blackout caused an eight-minute play stoppage did Manning finally put the Giants' first touchdown on the board, in the form of a 5-yard pass to Manningham. The teams continued to trade touchdowns; a 24-yard pass from Kitna to Austin was followed by a 35-yard reception by Boss. But the Giants' turnover problem resurfaced in the fourth quarter, where a fumble and an interception ended up costing them any chance at a comeback.",FAIL,"The correct answer is 'eight-minute'.

how to make hot water heater circulate,"passage 1:For a modest sized pump, this might be 400 to 800 KWH a year if the pump runs all the time. Heat loss from the pipe. Whenever the two pipes are hot, they will be losing heat. This heat comes from the hot water tank, and the water heater must use more fuel to provide the heat.

passage 2:When a homeowner turns on a faucet, the cooled water sitting in the pipes circulates to the faucet first, so the homeowner has to wait for hot water. A hot water circulation pump sends cool water in the pipes back to the water heater through a return line. A pump circulates this water through the water heater as needed to keep it hot. This continuous loop of water through the water heater ensures that hot water is always available.

passage 3:Instead, recirculating pumps rapidly pull hot water from a water heater, while simultanously send cool water from the hot water lines back to the water heater to be reheated and reused. Demand systems can be controlled by the push of a button, a timer, or motion sensor.

Do evidence for overlap between idiopathic environmental intolerance and somatoform disorders?,"Idiopathic environmental intolerance (IEI), also known as multiple chemical sensitivity, is a chronic, polysymptomatic condition that cannot be explained by an organic disease. Physical and psychological complaints are believed to be sustained by low levels of chemically unrelated substances in the environment. At present, it is unclear whether IEI is an environmental illness or a variant of somatoform disorders (SFD). This study examined whether IEI can be distinguished from SFD with respect to self-reported symptoms, trait anxiety, body-related cognitions, and symptom attributions.
We compared 54 subjects with IEI, 54 subjects with SFD but without IEI, and 44 subjects with neither IEI nor SFD on symptom scales, psychological questionnaires, and structured interviews for IEI, depression, anxiety, and SFD.
More than half of the IEI subjects met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria of SFD. This group shared both symptoms and psychological features of somatization with the SFD group. IEI subjects who did not fulfill criteria for a specific SFD were less impaired by their chemical sensitivity but differed nevertheless from nonsomatoform controls by significantly higher symptom scores, higher trait anxiety, a focus on autonomic sensations, and more pronounced somatic symptom attributions. These psychological features were significantly associated with the burden of somatic symptoms in both SFD and IEI. Furthermore, self-reported allergy but not total immunoglobulin E correlated with symptom burden in the total sample.",PASS,"The provided answer is correct.

Here is the explanation:
The study found that more than half of the IEI subjects met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria of SFD, and the IEI and SFD groups shared both symptoms and psychological features of somatization. This suggests a significant overlap between IEI and SFD. The study also found that psychological features such as higher symptom scores, higher trait anxiety, focus on autonomic sensations, and more pronounced somatic symptom attributions were significantly associated with the burden of somatic symptoms in both SFD and IEI, further supporting the overlap between the two conditions",0,0,0,0,0,0,414
what is the effect of carbon footprint,"passage 1:Your carbon footprint measures the environmental impact of your lifestyle. Everything you do has an impact --- positive or negative --- on the environment. That's the concept behind your carbon footprint, which is one method of measuring the environmental effect of your lifestyle. A carbon footprint, measured in tons, indicates the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are produced as a result of your daily activities. You can reduce your footprint by changing the way you live your life. Even seemingly tiny changes can make a significant difference.

passage 2:It all comes back to the average carbon footprint. The average per capita carbon footprint is 6 tons per year. In the U.S. the average is 20 tons per year, and a third of that is created by automobile emissions -- meaning your car itself can put out over 6 tons of C02 a year -- enough for two people.

passage 3:So what exactly is a carbon footprint? In simplest terms, carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases produced by various human activities within a given time frame. Carbon footprint is usually measured in tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere. Your home has a carbon footprint if you use oil, coal or gas to heat it. That cheeseburger at your favorite restaurant has a carbon footprint: raising the beef and wheat and operating the restaurant all involves greenhouse gases. Your car has a carbon footprint, dependent on the vehicle’s fuel consumption and driving distance.

",PASS,"The provided answer is correct.

Is atherosclerosis following renal injury ameliorated by pioglitazone and losartan via macrophage phenotype?,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) amplifies atherosclerosis, which involves renin-angiotensin system (RAS) regulation of macrophages. RAS influences peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), a modulator of atherogenic functions of macrophages, however, little is known about its effects in CKD. We examined the impact of combined therapy with a PPARγ agonist and angiotensin receptor blocker on atherogenesis in a murine uninephrectomy model.
Apolipoprotein E knockout mice underwent uninephrectomy (UNx) and treatment with pioglitazone (UNx + Pio), losartan (UNx + Los), or both (UNx + Pio/Los) for 10 weeks. Extent and characteristics of atherosclerotic lesions and macrophage phenotypes were assessed; RAW264.7 and primary peritoneal mouse cells were used to examine pioglitazone and losartan effects on macrophage phenotype and inflammatory response.
UNx significantly increased atherosclerosis. Pioglitazone and losartan each significantly reduced the atherosclerotic burden by 29.6% and 33.5%, respectively; although the benefit was dramatically augmented by combination treatment which lessened atherosclerosis by 55.7%. Assessment of plaques revealed significantly greater macrophage area in UNx + Pio/Los (80.7 ± 11.4% vs. 50.3 ± 4.2% in UNx + Pio and 57.2 ± 6.5% in UNx + Los) with more apoptotic cells. The expanded macrophage-rich lesions of UNx + Pio/Los had more alternatively activated, Ym-1 and arginine 1-positive M2 phenotypes (Ym-1: 33.6 ± 8.2%, p < 0.05 vs. 12.0 ± 1.1% in UNx; arginase 1: 27.8 ± 0.9%, p < 0.05 vs. 11.8 ± 1.3% in UNx). In vitro, pioglitazone alone and together with losartan was more effective than losartan alone in dampening lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production, suppressing M1 phenotypic change while enhancing M2 phenotypic change.",PASS,"### Check user input and provided answer

Does microinjection of specific anti-IMPDH2 antibodies induce disassembly of cytoplasmic rods/rings that are primarily stationary and stable structures?,"Our laboratory previously reported interesting rods 3-10 μm long and rings 2-5 μm diameter (RR) in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Experimental evidence show that both inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) and cytidine triphosphate synthetase (CTPS) are components of RR structures. Several cell types, including mouse embryonic stem cells, and cell lines, such as mouse 3 T3 and rat NRK, naturally present RR structures, while other cells can present RR when treated with compounds interfering with GTP/CTP biosynthetic pathways. In this study, we aimed to investigate the dynamic behavior of these RR in live cells.
RR were detected in >90% of COS-7 and HeLa cells treated with 1 mM ribavirin or 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) for 24 h, and in 75% of COS-7 cells treated with 1 mM mycophenolic acid (MPA) for the same period of time. Microinjection of affinity-purified anti-IMPDH2 antibodies in live COS-7 cells treated with ribavirin, DON, or MPA showed mature forms of RR presented as stable and stationary structures in 71% of cells. In the remaining 29% of cells, RR acquired erratic movement and progressively disassembled into fragments and disappeared within 10 min. The specific stationary state and antibody-dependent disassembling of RR structures was independently confirmed in COS-7 and HeLa cells transfected with GFP-tagged IMPDH2.",FAIL,"The provided answer is correct.

Here is the explanation:
The question asks whether microinjection of specific anti-IMPDH2 antibodies induce disassembly of cytoplasmic rods/rings that are primarily stationary and stable structures.

"How many months elapsed between the treaty between Henry and Charles, and the capture of Luxembourg?","On 31 December 1543, Henry and Charles had signed a treaty pledging to invade France in person by 20 June 1544; each was to provide an army of no less than 35,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry for the venture. Against this Francis could muster about 70,000 men in his various armies. The campaign could not begin, however, until Henry and Charles had resolved their personal conflicts with Scotland and the German princes, respectively. On 15 May, Henry was informed by Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, that, after his raids, Scotland was no longer in a position to threaten him; he then began to make preparations for a personal campaign in France—against the advice of his council and the Emperor, who believed that his presence would be a hindrance. Charles had meanwhile reached an understanding with the princes at the Diet of Speyer, and the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg had agreed to join his invasion of France. By May 1544, two Imperial armies were poised to invade France: one, under Ferrante Gonzaga, Viceroy of Sicily, north of Luxemburg; the other, under Charles himself, in the Palatinate. Charles had gathered a combined force of more than 42,000 for the invasion, and had arranged for another 4,000 men to join the English army. On 25 May, Gonzaga captured Luxembourg and moved towards Commercy and Ligny, issuing a proclamation that the Emperor had come to overthrow ""a tyrant allied to the Turks"".

Is a pro-inflammatory glycoprotein biomarker associated with lower bilirubin in metabolic syndrome?,"Bilirubin exerts anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties which may beneficially influence the development of cardio-metabolic disorders. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based glycoprotein biomarker, designated GlycA, whose signal originates from several glycosylated acute-phase proteins, has been recently developed. We tested whether plasma GlycA is associated with bilirubin in subjects with and without MetS.
GlycA (NMR spectroscopy), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and bilirubin were measured in 58 fasting subjects with MetS and in 63 subjects without MetS (including 65 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus).
GlycA and hs-CRP were higher, coinciding with lower bilirubin in MetS (p<0.01 for each). In all subjects combined, GlycA was strongly correlated with hs-CRP (r=0.631, p<0.001). Age-, sex- and diabetes status-adjusted multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated that GlycA and hs-CRP were both associated positively with the presence of MetS (β=0.256, p=0.014 and β=0.259, p=0.012, respectively). GlycA and hs-CRP were negatively related to bilirubin (β=-0.258, p=0.007 and β=-0.305, p<0.001, respectively), independent of MetS (p>0.05 for each) and diabetes status (p>0.50 for each).",FAIL,"The provided answer is correct.

The Novgorodians asked the Swedish king to install one of his sons — Carl Filip or Gustavus Adolphus — as their monarch. In the meantime, Gustavus Adolphus succeeded to the Swedish throne. The young king decided to press his brother's claim to the Russian throne even after the Poles had been expelled from Moscow by a patriotic uprising of 1612 and Mikhail Romanov had been elected a new tsar. While the Swedish statesmen envisaged the creation of a Trans-Baltic dominion extending northwards to Archangelsk and eastwards to Vologda, De la Gardie and other Swedish soldiers, still holding Novgorod and Ingria, saw the war as a reaction for their forces not receiving payment for their succour during the De la Gardie Campaign. In 1613 they advanced towards Tikhvin and laid a siege to the city, but were repelled. The Russian counter-offensive failed to regain Novgorod, however. The Russian tsar refused to commit his troops to battle and the war lumbered on until 1614, when the Swedes captured Gdov. The following year they laid siege to Pskov but Russian generals Morozov and Buturlin held their own until 27 February 1617, when the Treaty of Stolbovo stripped Russia of its access to the Baltic Sea and awarded to Sweden the province of Ingria with the townships of Ivangorod, Jama, Koporye and Noteborg.

How many years did the Gothic War last?,"The Bishop of Rome, called the Pope, was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles Simon Peter and Paul of Tarsus there. The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter, who is considered the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the Catholic Church. After the Decline of the Roman Empire in 476 AD, Rome was first under the control of Odoacer and then became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom before returning to Byzantine Empire control after the Gothic War (535-554), which devastated the city. Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to 500,000 in 273 to 35,000 after the Gothic War (535-554), reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins, vegetation, vineyards and market gardens.

Do simultaneous Hypoxia and Low Extracellular pH Suppress Overall Metabolic Rate and Protein Synthesis In Vitro?,"The tumor microenvironment is characterized by regions of hypoxia and acidosis which are linked to poor prognosis. This occurs due to an aberrant vasculature as well as high rates of glycolysis and lactate production in tumor cells even in the presence of oxygen (the Warburg effect), which weakens the spatial linkage between hypoxia and acidosis.
Five different human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SiHa, FaDuDD, UTSCC5, UTSCC14 and UTSCC15) were treated with hypoxia, acidosis (pH 6.3), or a combination, and gene expression analyzed using microarray. SiHa and FaDuDD were chosen for further characterization of cell energetics and protein synthesis. Total cellular ATP turnover and relative glycolytic dependency was determined by simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption and lactate synthesis rates and total protein synthesis was determined by autoradiographic quantification of the incorporation of 35S-labelled methionine and cysteine into protein.
Microarray analysis allowed differentiation between genes induced at low oxygen only at normal extracellular pH (pHe), genes induced at low oxygen at both normal and low pHe, and genes induced at low pHe independent of oxygen concentration. Several genes were found to be upregulated by acidosis independent of oxygenation. Acidosis resulted in a more wide-scale change in gene expression profiles than hypoxia including upregulation of genes involved in the translation process, for example Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A, isoform 2 (EIF4A2), and Ribosomal protein L37 (RPL37). Acidosis suppressed overall ATP turnover and protein synthesis by 50%. Protein synthesis, but not total ATP production, was also suppressed under hypoxic conditions. A dramatic decrease in ATP turnover (SiHa) and protein synthesis (both cell lines) was observed when hypoxia and low pHe were combined.",PASS,"The answer is correct.

Here is the explanation:
The question asks whether hypoxia and low extracellular pH (acidosis) simultaneously suppress overall metabolic rate and protein synthesis in vitro. The text states that a dramatic decrease in ATP turnover and protein synthesis was observed when hypoxia and low pHe were combined, which suggests that yes, they do suppress overall metabolic rate and protein synthesis simultaneously.

Is the risk of all-cause mortality inversely related to serum 25 ( OH ) D levels?,"Vitamin D plays a key role in maintaining bone health, but evidence for its nonskeletal effects is inconsistent. This study aims to examine the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and all-cause mortality in a large general population cohort.
Using the computerized database of the largest health care provider in Israel, we identified a cohort of subjects 20 years old or older with serum 25(OH)D levels measured between January 2008 and December 2009. Vital status was ascertained through August 2011.
Median follow-up was 28.5 months (interquartile range 23.8-33.5 months); 7,247 of 182,152 participants (4.0%) died. Subjects who died had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D levels (mean 44.8 ± 24.2 nmol/liter) than those alive at the end of follow-up (51.0 ± 23.2 nmol/liter), P < 0.001. After adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, and seasonality, the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 2.02 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89-2.15] for the lowest serum 25(OH)D quartile (<33.8 nmol/liter) compared with the highest. After further adjustment for comorbidity, use of vitamin D supplements and statins, smoking, socioeconomic status, and body mass index, the HR was 1.81 (95% CI 1.69-1.95). This remained, even after adjustment for serum low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, calcium level (corrected for serum albumin levels), and glomerular filtration rate, 1.85 (95% CI 1.70-2.01).

Does targeting of COX-2 expression by recombinant adenovirus shRNA attenuate the malignant biological behavior of breast cancer cells?,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), considered to have tumor-promoting potential, is highly expressed in a variety of tumors, including breast cancer. Since the functions and action mechanisms of COX-2 in breast cancer have not been fully elucidated, in the present study, the effects of target inhibiting COX-2 with recombinant adenovirus Ad-COX-2-shRNA on malignant biological behavior were investigated in representative cell lines.
Breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were transfected with Ad-COX-2-shRNA and COX-2 expression was tested by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Changes in proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of breast cancer cells were detected with various assays including MTT, colony forming, flowcytometry and Transwell invasion tests. The expression of related proteins involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion and signaling pathways was assessed by Western blotting.
COX-2 expression was significantly reduced in both breast cancer cell lines infected with Ad-COX-2-shRNA, with obvious inhibition of proliferation, colony forming rate, G2/M phase passage and invasion, as well as induction of apoptosis, in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, respectively. At the same time, proteins related to the cell cycle, anti-apoptosis and invasion were significantly downregulated. In addition, c-myc expression and phosphorylation activation of Wnt/β-catenin and p38MAPK pathways were reduced by the Ad-COX-2-shRNA.",FAIL,"The provided answer is correct.

Is hDL particle size a critical determinant of ABCA1-mediated macrophage cellular cholesterol export?,"High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a heterogeneous population of particles. Differences in the capacities of HDL subfractions to remove cellular cholesterol may explain variable correlations between HDL-cholesterol and cardiovascular risk and inform future targets for HDL-related therapies. The ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) facilitates cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I, but the majority of apolipoprotein A-I in the circulation is transported in a lipidated state and ABCA1-dependent efflux to individual HDL subfractions has not been systematically studied.
Our aims were to determine which HDL particle subfractions are most efficient in mediating cellular cholesterol efflux from foam cell macrophages and to identify the cellular cholesterol transporters involved in this process.
We used reconstituted HDL particles of defined size and composition, isolated subfractions of human plasma HDL, cell lines stably expressing ABCA1 or ABCG1, and both mouse and human macrophages in which ABCA1 or ABCG1 expression was deleted. We show that ABCA1 is the major mediator of macrophage cholesterol efflux to HDL, demonstrating most marked efficiency with small, dense HDL subfractions (HDL3b and HDL3c). ABCG1 has a lesser role in cholesterol efflux and a negligible role in efflux to HDL3b and HDL3c subfractions.",PASS,"### Response: PASS

The provided answer is correct. It matches the information in the passage.

Never rub the hair back and forth or in circles with a towel as this will cause damage to the hair.

passage 2:Oh, and a great shampoo feels good, too. Here's how to do it right. 1) First, you'll want to make sure to select the proper shampoo and conditioner for your hair type. 2) While in the shower, make sure your water is warm, but not too hot. Turn the flow down just a bit so you're not splashing all over the place. 3) Thoroughly wet the hair. 4) Apply a bit of shampoo into the palm of your hand (a nickel sized amount is usually just about right) and work it through the hair. If your hair is longer, don't pile it up on your head, instead comb through it with your fingers to reduce tangles.

passage 3:Wrap a towel or pat it gently to soak the water from hair. Avoid rubbing it with a towel to dry it. Wet hair is weak and such frictions can lead to damage, hence handle your hair with proper care to make them beautiful. Use a hair dryer Now use a hair dryer to completely dry your hair.

Accounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances such as a change in reporting units or the
testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division.
As described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2022, the Company changed its business segment reporting. For any product changes that resulted in reporting unit
changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units, the results of which were immaterial.
Goodwill balances reported above reflect these business segment reporting changes in the earliest period presented. The Company also completed its annual goodwill
impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2022 for all reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Additionally, in December 2022, as a result of 3M's commitment
to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing as described in Note 15, 3M recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $0.3 billion related to the
Advanced Materials reporting unit (within the Transportation and Electronics business) resulting in no remaining goodwill for that reporting unit. This also represents the
Company's accumulated goodwill impairment losses as of December 31, 2022.
",FAIL,"PASS

The provided answer is correct. According to the context, there was a significant decrease of $271 million in goodwill on 3M's balance sheet in 2022, not an increase. The key drivers were the goodwill impairment charge of $0.3 billion related to the Advanced Materials reporting unit and the annual goodwill impairment test, which determined no impairment existed. Additionally, there was no acquisition of a Food Safety Business in 2022, which is also mentioned in the answer.",0,0,0,0,0,0,620
Do tGFβ and IL10 have an impact on risk group and prognosis in childhood ALL?,"Cytokines and their genes have been described to have an influence on incidence and prognosis in malignant, infectious and autoimmune disease. We previously described the impact of cytokine production on prognosis in paediatric standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).
In this study, we investigated the influence of cytokine gene polymorphisms (TNFα, TGFβ, IL10 and IFNγ) on frequency, risk group and prognosis in 95 paediatric ALL-patients. We further report on intracellular production of these cytokines in T-cells.
IL10 high-producer-haplotypes were reduced in ALL-patients compared with healthy controls and resulted in a reduced relapse rate compared with low-producer haplotypes. TGFβ high-producer-haplotypes were correlated with a high initial blast-count (codon 25: G/G) and were elevated in high-risk ALL-patients (codon 10: T/T). IL10 was positively and IFNγ-production was negatively correlated with initial blast-count. At diagnosis the expression of TNFα and IFNγ was reduced in patients compared with healthy controls. This was more pronounced in high-risk and in T-ALL-patients.",PASS,"The provided answer is correct.

Here is the explanation:
The question asks if tGFβ and IL10 have an impact on risk group and prognosis in childhood ALL. According to the passage, it is stated that ""TGFβ high-producer-haplotypes were correlated with a high initial blast-count and were elevated in high-risk ALL-patients. IL10 high-producer-haplotypes were reduced in ALL-patients compared with healthy controls and resulted in a reduced relapse rate compared with low-producer haplotypes.""

Is anti-nociception mediated by a κ opioid receptor agonist blocked by a δ receptor agonist?,"The opioid receptor family comprises four structurally homologous but functionally distinct sub-groups, the μ (MOP), δ (DOP), κ (KOP) and nociceptin (NOP) receptors. As most opioid agonists are selective but not specific, a broad spectrum of behaviours due to activation of different opioid receptors is expected. In this study, we examine whether other opioid receptor systems influenced KOP-mediated antinociception.
We used a tail withdrawal assay in C57Bl/6 mice to assay the antinociceptive effect of systemically administered opioid agonists with varying selectivity at KOP receptors. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to analyse the interactions of the other opioid receptors in modulating KOP-mediated antinociception.
Etorphine, a potent agonist at all four opioid receptors, was not anti-nociceptive in MOP knockout (KO) mice, although etorphine is an efficacious KOP receptor agonist and specific KOP receptor agonists remain analgesic in MOP KO mice. As KOP receptor agonists are aversive, we considered KOP-mediated antinociception might be a form of stress-induced analgesia that is blocked by the anxiolytic effects of DOP receptor agonists. In support of this hypothesis, pretreatment with the DOP antagonist, naltrindole (10 mg·kg(-1) ), unmasked etorphine (3 mg·kg(-1) ) antinociception in MOP KO mice. Further, in wild-type mice, KOP-mediated antinociception by systemic U50,488H (10 mg·kg(-1) ) was blocked by pretreatment with the DOP agonist SNC80 (5 mg·kg(-1) ) and diazepam (1 mg·kg(-1) ).",PASS,"The answer is correct.

The text states that in wild-type mice, KOP-mediated antinociception by systemic U50,488H (10 mg·kg(-1)) was blocked by pretreatment with the DOP agonist SNC80 (5 mg·kg(-1)) and diazepam (1 mg·kg(-1)). This suggests that anti-nociception mediated by a κ opioid receptor agonist (U50,488H) was blocked by a δ receptor agonist (SNC80). Therefore, the answer is correct.

Does an additional antirotation U-Blade (RC) lag screw improve treatment of AO/OTA 31 A1-3 fractures with gamma 3 nail?,"Poor bone quality and unstable fractures increase the cut-out rate in implants with gliding lag screws. The U-Blade (RC) lag screw for the Gamma3®nail was introduced to provide monoaxial rotational stability of the femoral head and neck fragment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the use of the U-Blade (RC) lag screw is associated with reduced cut-out in patients with OTA/AO 31A1-3 fractures.MATERIAL &
Between 2009 and 2014, 751 patients with OTA/AO 31A1-3 fractures were treated with a Gamma3®nail at our institution. Out of this sample 199 patients were treated with U-blade (RC) lag screws. A total of 135 patients (117 female, 18 male) with standard lag screw (treatment group A) were matched equally regarding age (±4 years) sex, fracture type and location to 135 patients with U-blade (RC) lag screw (treatment group B). Within a mean follow up of 9.2 months (range 6-18 months) we assessed the cut-out rate, the calTAD, lag screw migration, the Parker's mobility score and the Parker's ratio at postoperatively, six and 12 months following surgery. Furthermore we recorded all complications, ASA-Score, hospital stay and duration of surgery retrospectively.
The most common fracture among group B with a cut-out of the lag screw were AO/OTA 2.3 and 3.2 fractures whereas in group A cut-out was most commonly seen in AO/OTA 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 fractures, there was no significant reduction of the cut-out rate in group B 2.2% (n=3) compared to group A 3.7% (n=5). The duration of surgery was significantly shorter in group A (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in lag screw placement, the Parker's ratio and mobilization.",PASS,"The answer is correct.
