Explanation: In this scenario, the patient is in a supine position and the T6 level of block indicates that the sympathetic outflow from the spinal cord below T6 is intact. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex is unlikely as it is a vagal reflex triggered by stretch of the atria, which is not related to the level of block.

The Bainbridge reflex is an increase in heart rate with an increase in central venous pressure, which is not the case here.

The block of cardio-accelerator fibers of sympathetic origin is unlikely as the patient's heart rate is decreased.
