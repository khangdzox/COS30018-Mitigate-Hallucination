"If the symphysiofundal height is 40 cm and the station of the head is at -1, weight of the fetus is approximately",FCT,4.3 kg,"Correct answer: 4 kg

The given height is symphysiofundal height, which is related to the weight of the fetus by the formula:

Weight (in kg) = 0.3 x (Symphysiofundal height in cm) + 0.5

Given height is 40 cm. So, weight = 0.3 x 40 + 0.5 = 12 + 0.5 = 12.5. As the weight cannot be in decimal, it should be rounded to the nearest whole number. So, the weight is 13 kg.
