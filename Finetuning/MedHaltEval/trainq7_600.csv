He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 5 years ago. Physical examination shows an increased anteroposterior chest diameter and coarse crackles in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Treatment with a drug that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways is begun. Which of the following drugs was most likely started?,NOTA,None of the above,"Correct answer: 3

Explanation: The patient presents with symptoms of chronic bronchitis, including cough productive of thick sputum, which suggests reversible airway obstruction. The presence of coarse crackles in the lung fields also supports this diagnosis. The treatment with a drug that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways suggests that the patient was likely started on an anticholinergic medication, such as cromolyn. Cromolyn is a non-specific antagonist of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the airway smooth muscle, which can reverse bronchospasm and increase airflow.

Which of the following viruses requires DNA polymerases from the host cell for replication ?:,NOTA,None of the above,"Review

The correct answer is:

1

Explanation:

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has a unique replication strategy that involves the synthesis of a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) intermediate, which is used as a template for the synthesis of new viral DNA. This process requires the activity of host cell DNA polymerases, specifically the host cell DNA polymerase and primase. The host cell DNA polymerase synthesizes the viral DNA using the viral genome as a template, while the primase provides the primer required for the initiation of DNA synthesis. This unique replication strategy is different from that of other viruses, which typically",0.066666667,6.63E-232,0.062499999,0,0.062499999,0.00990099,0.25,106
