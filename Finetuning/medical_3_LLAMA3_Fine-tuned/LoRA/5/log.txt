1: max_seq_length recalculate. 4500
(Problem is that, if i put the too short max_seq_length then the input will be cut and loss)
Instead of put max_seq_length with normal dataset which may cause imcomplete input, i filtered dataset with maximum of 4500 token in text and put max_seq_length = 4500
2: change max_steps to 100
5: change per_device_train_batch_size = 1
7: change gradient_accumulation_steps = 4
8: eval_delay= 20

(Strange pattern happen again)
